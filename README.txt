This repository includes contributions by Tyler Case to the Novel Observations in Mixed Reality (NOMR)
project which started at the University of Washington my Dr. Jared [Cartwrite?]. 
https://github.com/Novel-Observations-in-Mixed-Reality/NOMR?tab=readme-ov-file.

Most scripts included are a part of a new experiment that Tyler started developing. The experiment will show particle interactions between electrons and lattice ions within a wire in an electrical circuit. The goal is to show students using these simulations what electricity is and how it works, demonstrating surface charge density which establishes the electric field, the relationship between current and temperature and resistivity, and to show how this all fits together to create a complete circuit.
